# Project-2-ETL Proposal


"Healthcare provider fraud detection analysis" from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/rohitrox/healthcare-provider-fraud-detection-analysis).
We are going to take the multiple CSVs from the dataset, process the data, look for insights (noted below), and then package and add to a database.  After, we will submit to github and deploy on a website (Github Pages).

We are looking at 2 different insights:
1. What are the most common Procedures and Diagnosis codes
2. Which states/localities have the highest number of frauds
